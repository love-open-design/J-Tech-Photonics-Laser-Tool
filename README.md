# LY Drawbot Tool by Love Open Design

This is the official repository for the XY Plotter Tool Inkscape extension.

You can find a french version of this document on our website : [love-open-design.com](https://love-open-design.com/laboratoire/xy-plotter-tool-par-love-open-design/)

## Purpose

This extension work for the [DIY XY Plotter High Precision Drawbot](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32917861259.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3d9f6c37xpT5iS)

* This is made for Inkscape 1.0 and above.
* This machin is using GRBL Control with GRBL Arduino Shield

## Installation

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/love-open-design/XY-Plotter-Tool-by-LOD/release). Make sure to select the release targeted towards the version of Inkscape you are using. You can find the version of Inkscape you're using under **Help** > **About**.

Unzip the files directly into the Inkscape user extensions folder. Inkscape lists the location of your extensions folder under **Edit** > **Preferences** > **System**.

Restart Inkscape and you're done.

## Usage

Open your SVG file in Inkscape.

Before using the extension, we need to make sure the document is setup correctly. Open File > Document Properties.

Set the document's display units to mm or in. 

This extension only parses the paths and ignores the rest. Therefore you need to Ctrl+A to select everything and then press Ctrl+Shift+C or choose Path-> Object to Path.

Now just run the extension with wanted parameters and press Apply to export to gcode.

### Custom G-code Header and Footer

Add "header" and "footer" text files without extensions in your destination directory to add custom commands. Don't forget to add a new line at the end of these two files.

If no files are detected the default values are :
- Header : G90 ; Absolute positioningon the
- Header : G0 Z0 ; Display path inside GRBL Control
- Footer : G1 X0 Y0 ; Move to X0 Y0

## For developers

Pull requests are welcome. Just make sure to test your code on both Python >=2.6 and >=3.5 for the main branch, and Python >= 3.6 for the development branch (In the next major release we'll drop support for older python versions in an effort to improve code readability).
